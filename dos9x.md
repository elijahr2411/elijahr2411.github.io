# Windows 9x and DOS Utilities
## My stuff
Stuff I've collected and am hosting on this website. Most of it I didn't make but just am hosting since the source is no longer available
- [MS-DOS 8.1](/dos81) My recommendation for a daily-use DOS system.
- [PC-DOS 7.1](/pcdos71) (A good alternative to MS-DOS 6.22, if you don't want to use 8.0)
- [SciTech Display Doctor Beta 7](https://github.com/elijahr2411/mystuff/raw/main/sdd-win-7.0.0.340-BETA.exe) Display driver that works for Windows 95 and 98. Allows 32-Bit color mode in a VM. Registration: `Name: CSCKnight Serial: 0B5E-12B4-A8A4-0B`
